                      many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains 
                      a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

                      <b>History of JavaScript: </b> It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. It was originally going to be named LiveScript 
                    but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. It is designed to run as a scripting language 
                    in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. The most common host environment is the browser.
